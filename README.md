# agentic-RAG

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced AI system architecture where an autonomous agent makes intelligent, dynamic decisions about the retrieval and generation process to answer queries effectively.
Unlike traditional RAG systems that follow a fixed "retrieve-then-generate" pipeline, Agentic RAG employs reasoning capabilities to determine.

This project is built using:

 * LangChain – Core orchestration framework

 * LangGraph – Agent workflow graph and state management

 * Google Flash 1.5 Pro – Primary LLM

 * HuggingFace Embedding Model – Sentence-transformer for embedding text

 * FAISS Vector Store – High-performance similarity search

 * Python – Implementation & API wrappers

# multimodal-RAG-System

A Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Vector Search to build an intelligent question-answering pipeline capable of understanding both images and text.
This project integrates:

 * CLIP (OpenAI) for image embedding extraction

 * Gemini Pro for language understanding + response generation

 * FAISS for high-performance vector similarity search

 * Python backend to orchestrate multimodal retrieval & generation
