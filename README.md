# multimodal-RAG-System

A Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Vector Search to build an intelligent question-answering pipeline capable of understanding both images and text.
This project integrates:

*CLIP (OpenAI) for image embedding extraction

*Gemini Pro for language understanding + response generation

*FAISS for high-performance vector similarity search

*Python backend to orchestrate multimodal retrieval & generation
